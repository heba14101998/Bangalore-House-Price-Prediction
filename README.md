# Bangalore House Price Prediction

Buying a home, especially in a city like Bengaluru, is a tricky choice. While the major factors are usually the same for all metros, there are others to be considered for the Silicon Valley of India. With its help millennial crowd, vibrant culture, great climate, and a slew of job opportunities, it is difficult to ascertain the price of a house in Bengaluru.

By cleaning and analyzing the Bangalore home dataset, we will be able to understand how house prices are affected by various factors, and then apply machine learning regression to establish an approximate price for the properties. In this work, I presented a study approach that utilizes a variety of methods (Logistic Regression, K-Folds, and DNN) to predict the houses price, and the deep learning model agreed on the others with an accuracy of 91.2 %.
